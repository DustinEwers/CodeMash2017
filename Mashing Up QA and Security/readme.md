Security is domain specific quality assurance, but developers, testers, and security 
professionals often don’t work together. When this type of disconnect exists between 
big groups of people who are very good at their jobs, there is usually a mostly 
untapped potential for learning. I’ve been exploring this landscape by writing an 
open source fuzzer aimed at discovering new test cases (not just crashes!) using 
binary rewriting of managed executables and genetic modification of a test corpus, 
implemented in F# and using Mono.Cecil. I’ll contrast the fundamentals of each 
discipline, demonstrate tools used by experts on both sides of the security and QA 
fence, and challenge the audience to find new ways to mix them up. Expect to see lots 
of code and leave with ideas for making entire communities better, not just your own 
team!
