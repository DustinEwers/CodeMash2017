If you’ve ever suspected that “all programming languages are pretty much the same; they just have 
different syntax,” well, you will never suspect that again! Covering languages from the unusually 
powerful (Idris) to the illuminated (قلب) to the profoundly limited (BlooP), and all points in 
between, these languages will help you think differently about approaches to software problems you 
face in your day job. Of course we’ll have a lot of fun, but these languages are no joke. The 
practical benefit of an impractical language is the power to find new approaches to common 
problems.
