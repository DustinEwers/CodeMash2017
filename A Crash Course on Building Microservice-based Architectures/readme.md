Driven by popular DevOps stories, many large and successful companies are implementing and singing the praises of microservice-based architectures. Is it time for your organization to get on board too? 

In this session, we’ll discuss:
* Why implementing microservice-based architectures is something to consider
* How this approach is different from “traditional” service-oriented architectures
* How microserice-based applications are designed and implemented
* Benefits and possible pitfalls to work around
* Tooling tricks to give you a head start to “predictable” success 

We’ll also talk about topics such as state management, data persistence, transaction support and the role of the enterprise so you can better decide if you should stay with your current process or go forward with a microservice-based architecture.
